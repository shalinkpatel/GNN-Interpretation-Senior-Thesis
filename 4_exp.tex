\section{Experimental Setup}
As was discussed in \S\ref{sec:benchmark-datasets}, there are many issues with the benchmarks that were proposed by \cite{yuan_explainability_2021}. Therefore, a major goal of this work was to confirm the intuition that these benchmarks were off. Then, the aim was to create a new set of benchmarks against which GNN interpretation models can be tested against. In this section, the methodology of these experiments will be walked through.
